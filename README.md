# Assignment 1 - BrokenApplication
## The assignment
To start with this assignment make sure you followed the before starting section.
This application is intentionally designed as 'broken' so that you can train your problem solving skills. 
There are a couple of problems:
 * Syntax errors
 * Exceptions like NullReferences, DividedByZero
 * Variables that miss data types
The goal is to fix all the errors, document what went wrong and why, then make sure the whole application works again!

## How and what to hand in
 * Document your findings in your portfolio
 * Screen-shots of before and afterwards of all errors/exceptions that occurred
 * Include some explanation why this happened and how you solved it
 
Hand this in as a word document in the designated study route
